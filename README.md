# Arduino Starter Kit – Project Log

This repository contains all projects I'm building using the Elegoo UNO R3 Super Starter Kit.

The goal is to learn the fundamentals of electronics, microcontrollers, and prototyping – and to build the foundation for creating real-world hardware systems.
Each project is documented with:
- Circuit diagrams and breadboard photos
- Arduino code
- Reflections and lessons learned

##  Long-Term Vision

To use this experience to develop more advanced systems with ESP32, IoT, and hardware-integrated AI.

## 📁 Projects


## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Arduino UNO R3
- Arduino IDE
- C++ (Arduino-style syntax)
- Breadboard, sensors, and components from the Elegoo kit

## 👤 About Me

I'm an electronics engineering student at OsloMet, using this repository to document my journey from beginner to hardware developer and future founder.
