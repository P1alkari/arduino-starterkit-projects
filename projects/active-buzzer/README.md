Active Buzzer Test – Lesson 6
This project uses the Elegoo UNO R3 Super Starter Kit to control an active buzzer using a digital output pin.

🔌 Circuit Overview
Microcontroller: Arduino UNO R3

Component: Active Buzzer (with built-in oscillator)

Pin connection:

Buzzer + → Digital Pin 8

Buzzer - → GND

Power source: 5V from Arduino

💡 What I Learned
How to properly connect an active buzzer to Arduino.

The importance of correct polarity (+ and -) for buzzers.

How to control the buzzer using digital signals (HIGH/LOW).

⚠️ Troubleshooting Experience
At first, no sound came from the buzzer. The issue was:

Polarity reversed: I had the + and - pins swapped.

After correcting the wiring, the buzzer worked as expected.

Lesson learned: Always double-check component polarity before powering the circuit.
