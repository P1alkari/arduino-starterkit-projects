# RGB LED Project

This project uses an RGB LED to display multiple colors by controlling three individual LEDs (red, green, blue) inside one package.

## üíª Code
See the file [rgb-led.ino](./rgb-led.ino).

## üí° What I Learned

- How an RGB LED combines red, green, and blue light to make new colors
- The importance of using separate resistors for each color channel
- How PWM (analogWrite) controls brightness and mixes colors

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Experience

- At first, one color did not light up because of a loose connection on the breadboard.
- Learned to test each color channel individually before combining them.
