# 🔴 LED Power Test

This is my first project using the Elegoo UNO R3 Super Starter Kit.  
The goal was to power an LED using a 220Ω resistor and verify that the circuit works correctly.

## 🔌 Circuit Overview

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino UNO R3
- **Component**: Red LED
- **Resistor**: 220Ω (to limit current)
- **Power source**: 5V from Arduino

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to properly connect an LED on a breadboard
- Polarity of LEDs (long leg = +, short leg = -)
- Importance of using resistors to avoid burning out components

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting Experience

The first LED might have burned out because I may have:
- Connected it without a resistor
- Reversed polarity
- Used wrong voltage

Lesson: Always double-check connections before powering the board.
